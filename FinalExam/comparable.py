    This class uses a class variable to count the number of times 
    the compare method is called.  It is designed to be inherited  
    from classes that implement the compare method, who want to 
    keep a count of the number of compares performed in the program.
    The subclass should first call this base class compare method, 
    and then do the comparison between itself and another object 
    of its same type.
